                        <h2>Definition</h2>
                        <p class="lead">Oregano is a herb from the mint, or Lamiaceae family. People have used it for thousands of years to add flavor to dishes and to treat health conditions. It features in the Mediterranean diet. The Greeks and Romans associated oregano with joy and happiness. The name comes from the Greek words “oros,” meaning mountain, and “ganos,” meaning joy. </p>
                        <hr>
                        <h2>Benefits</h2>
                        <img src= "ben.jpg" style="height:200px;">
                         <p class="lead">Oregano may help fight bacteria, relieve inflammation, and regulate blood sugar. People around the Mediterranean region have used oregano for centuries in herbal medicine to treat many ailments, including:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>skins sores</li>
                            <li>aching muscles</li>
                            <li>asthma</li>
                            <li>cramping</li>
                            <li>diarrhea</li>
                            <li>indigestion</li>
                            <li>colds</li>
                       </ul>
                         <p class="lead">To boost overall health scientists need to do more research to confirm the benefits of using oregano, but there is some evidence that it could help: fight bacteria relieve inflammation regulate blood sugar and lipids fight cancer Oregano and other herbs provide antioxidants. Dietary antioxidants help the body eliminate free radicals, which are toxic substances that result from natural processes and environmental stresses. A buildup of free radicals can trigger oxidative stress. Oxidative stress can lead to cell damage that may result in various diseases, including cancer and diabetes. </p>
                         <p class="lead">Antibacterial properties, The main components of oregano essential oil are carvacrol and thymol. These may have antimicrobial properties.</p>
                         <p class="lead">The oil showed “significant antibacterial activity” against 11 such microbes. This suggests that substances in oregano could play a role in fighting diseases that no longer respond to antibiotics.</p>
                         <p class="lead">While these tests indicate that compounds in oregano may have antibacterial properties, it does not mean that eating oregano will prevent infections.</p>
                         <p class="lead">Anti-inflammatory properties according to one literature overview, the oils and constituents of oregano oil, such as thymol and rosmarinic acid, appear to have anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
                         <p class="lead">In animal studies, oregano extract has reduced inflammation that could lead to: autoimmune arthritis allergic asthma rheumatoid arthritis.</p>
                         <p class="lead">Protecting against cancer Some of the ingredients in oregano may have anticancer properties.</p>
                         <p class="lead">Scientists have found evidence that extracts may help prevent DNA damage in cells due to oxidative stress, radiation, and mitogens, a type of protein that can cause unwanted cell division.</p>
                         <p class="lead">Diabetes compounds in oregano may help manage type 2 diabetes. Authors of a 2016 rodent studyTrusted Source concluded that Origanum extract may help: improve insulin resistance regulate the expression of genes that affect fat and carbohydrate metabolism restore damaged liver and kidney tissues.</p>
                        <p class="lead">Depression, In 2018, scientistsTrusted Source looked at how treatment with oregano oil and other substances affected rats with depression due to chronic unpredictable stress. After 14 days, stress-related behavior improved in rats that received the oregano treatment. The study authors concluded that oregano might relieve stress-related behavior.</p>
                        <p class="lead">Other possible health benefits According to the National Library of Medicine, people take oregano products by mouth for:

                        <h2>Side Effect of Oregano</h2>
                        <img src= "2.jpeg" style="height:200px;">
                        <p class="lead">When taken by mouth: Oregano leaf and oregano oil are likely safe when eaten in foods. There isn't enough reliable information to know if oregano is safe to use in amounts greater than those found in food. Mild side effects include stomach upset. </p>
                        <p class="lead">When applied to the skin: There isn't enough reliable information to know if oregano oil is safe to apply to the skin. It may cause irritation when applied in concentrations greater than 1%. </p>
                        <p class="lead">Oregano may worsen bleeding disorders or increase bleeding tendencies in people on medications that slow blood clotting (such as aspirin, clopidogrel, heparin, enoxaparin, and warfarin). Due to the increased risk of bleeding, oregano supplements must be stopped at least 2 weeks before surgery.</p>
                        <p class="lead">Oregano may lower blood sugar levels. Thus, people on antidiabetic medications must closely monitor their blood sugar levels if they use oregano supplements.</p>
                        <p class="lead">The safety of using oregano supplements in pregnancy and lactation is not well understood. Thus, pregnant women and breastfeeding mothers should avoid using oregano as medication.</p>

                        <h2>Why does oregano important to human life</h2>
                        <p class="lead">There is absolutely a time and a place for modern medicine. I’m a believer in a little ibuprofen or acetaminophen for a fever, and, in my opinion, nothing beats Benadryl for an allergic rash. Still, some of the side effects of modern meds should leave you a little concerned (usually about your liver or upset stomach). It may be unconventional, but a common ingredient found in your home may help you manage your GI symptoms, treat headaches or ease your muscle pain. Roll out the red carpet for... oregano!</p>
                        <p class="lead">This little plant needs to be in your kitchen and medicine cabinet, as it's a delicious healing agent. There are over 40 varieties of oregano, but Origanum vulgare is the one most linked to health benefits. You can use the fresh and dried leaves in your cooking for medicinal benefits as well as flavor.x</p>
